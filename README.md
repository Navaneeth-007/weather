# Weather App
This project aims to develop a web application which can be used to find weather of any place.

A weather web application is a type of web application that provides users with weather-related information for specific locations. Users can typically input a location (such as a city name or geographic coordinates), and the application retrieves and displays current weather conditions, forecasts, and other relevant data.Under the hood, a weather web application typically relies on a weather API (Application Programming Interface) to fetch real-time and forecast data. This data is then processed and displayed to the user through a front-end interface, which can be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The back-end of the application may handle user requests, data processing, and interfacing with the weather API.

Overall, a weather web application aims to provide users with accurate and timely weather information in a user-friendly and accessible manner, helping them plan activities, stay informed about weather conditions, and make informed decisions based on the forecasted weather.
