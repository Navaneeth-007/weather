# Weather App
This project aims to develop a web application which can be used to find weather of any place.
Here, I used HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT to create the webpage.
The webpage make use of the free weather api by OpenWeatherMap for fetching weather info.
The user has to type the name of the place which he want to find the weather details and then click the button to get weather info.
